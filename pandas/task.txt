20 Medium-Level Pandas Tasks (Based on Covered Topics)
These tasks are designed to test your understanding of DataFrame creation, inspection, selection (loc, iloc), and basic modification (add/drop/rename columns).

Setup for all tasks:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# Use this initial dictionary for tasks where 'data' is needed unless specified otherwise
data = {
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 35, 40, 22, 28, 45],
    "City": ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Houston", "Phoenix", "Philadelphia", "San Antonio"],
    "Salary": [70000, 80000, 120000, 90000, 60000, 75000, 110000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
Tasks
Create and Inspect: Create a DataFrame from the data dictionary. Print the specific shape of the DataFrame (rows, columns) and show the data types of all columns.
Custom Index creation: Create a new DataFrame df_custom from data but set the index to be specific IDs: ['ID1', 'ID2', 'ID3', 'ID4', 'ID5', 'ID6', 'ID7'].
Column Selection: Create a new DataFrame df_subset containing only the "Name" and "Salary" columns from df.
Row Slicing (Integer): Use iloc to select rows 2 through 5 (inclusive of index 2, exclusive of 5 depending on slice logic, or just indices 2,3,4) and all columns.
Row and Column Slicing (Label): Use loc to select the "Name" and "Age" for the rows with index labels 1, 3, and 5.
Cell Access: Use iloc to print the "City" of the 4th row (index 3).
Head and Tail: Print the first 3 rows and the last 2 rows of the DataFrame in a single script execution.
Describe Objects: Use df.describe() but try to include all columns (including objects like strings), not just numbers. (Hint: look up include='all' or check dtypes).
Rename Single: Rename the "Salary" column to "Annual Income" in place (or reassign to df).
Rename Multiple: Rename "Name" to "Full Name" and "City" to "Location" simultaneously.
Drop Column: Remove the "City" column from the DataFrame.
Drop Row: Remove the row at index 3.
Add Constant Column: Add a new column "Country" and populate it with "USA" for all rows.
Add Calculated Column (Born Year): Assuming the current year is 2025, create a new column "Birth Year" by subtracting "Age" from 2025.
Add List Column: Add a new column "Department" using this list: ['HR', 'Eng', 'Eng', 'Sales', 'HR', 'Sales', 'Admin'].
Numpy conversion: Convert the underlying data of the DataFrame to a NumPy array and print it.
Empty DataFrame: Create an empty DataFrame. Then add two columns "A" and "B" with 3 values each.
Reorder Columns: Rearrange the columns so that "Age" appears before "Name".
Conditional Update (Manual): Update the "Age" of "Alice" (index 0) to 26 using at or loc.
Random Sample: specificy a random seed (optional) and select a random sample of 3 rows from the DataFrame.
