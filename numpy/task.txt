🔢 NumPy Practice Questions (Medium Level)

1. Array Creation
Create a NumPy array of numbers from 1 to 20. Then print its size.

2. Zeros & Ones
Create:

a 3×4 array filled with zeros

a 2×5 array filled with ones

3. Full Function
Create a 4×4 array where every value is 7 using NumPy.

4. Reshape
Create an array from 1 to 12 and reshape it into:

3×4

2×6

5. Flatten
Take a 3×3 matrix and convert it into a 1D array using flatten.

6. Arrange (arange)
Create an array starting from 10 to 50 with a step of 5.

7. Sum of Elements
Given array:
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Find:

total sum

sum of first 3 elements only

8. Matrix Addition
Add the following two arrays:

A = [[1,2,3],
     [4,5,6]]


B = [[6,5,4],
     [3,2,1]]

9. Matrix Subtraction
Subtract array B from array A (from Q8).

10. Element-wise Multiplication
Multiply arrays A and B element by element.

11. Mean
Find the mean of:
[12, 15, 20, 25, 30]

12. Median
Find the median of:
[5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 6]

13. Standard Deviation
Find the standard deviation of:
[4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 7]

14. Row-wise Sum
Given matrix:

[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]]

Find sum of each row separately.

15. Column-wise Sum
Using the same matrix from Q14, find sum of each column.

16. Reshape + Mean
Create numbers from 1 to 16, reshape into 4×4, then find the mean of each row.

17. Flatten + Size
Create a 5×5 ones matrix. Flatten it and find its size.

18. Arithmetic Combination
Given:
A = [1,2,3,4]
B = [5,6,7,8]

Compute:
(A + B) * 2

19. Mixed Operations
Create array from 1–9, reshape to 3×3. Multiply entire matrix by 5 and then find total sum.

20. Statistics Combo
Given:
[15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]

Find:

mean

median

standard deviation

hard

1. Advanced Reshape + Sum

Create an array from 1 to 48.
Reshape it into 4 × 4 × 3.
Find:

sum along axis 0

sum along axis 1

sum along axis 2

2. Conditional Replacement

Create array from 1 to 20.
Replace all numbers:

divisible by 3 → -1

divisible by 5 → 100

(Do it using NumPy, not loops.)

3. Broadcasting Math

Given:

A = np.array([[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]])


B = np.array([10,20,30])

Add B to every row of A using broadcasting.

4. Flatten vs Ravel Logic

Create a 3×3 matrix.
Use ravel() to flatten and modify the first element.
Then check whether original array changes.
Explain why.

5. Indexing Challenge

Create array 1–25 and reshape to 5×5.
Extract:

middle row

last column

corner elements only

6. Statistical Axis Problem

Given:

arr = np.array([[10,20,30],
                [40,50,60],
                [70,80,90]])

Find:

mean of each column

standard deviation of each row

7. Matrix Arithmetic Combo

Create two random 3×3 arrays.
Compute:

(A + B) * 2 - A

8. Pattern Matrix

Create this matrix using NumPy only:

[[1,0,1,0],
 [0,1,0,1],
 [1,0,1,0],
 [0,1,0,1]]

(No manual typing.)

9. 3D Array Stats

Create array from 1–27 and reshape to 3×3×3.
Find:

overall mean

mean along axis 0

median of entire array

10. Multi-step Transformation

Create array from 1–16.
Steps:

Reshape to 4×4

Multiply each column by [1,2,3,4]

Flatten result

Find standard deviation
