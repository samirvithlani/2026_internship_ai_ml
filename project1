📌 Typical size: small enough for beginners, but with realistic issues.

📘 Project Objective

Students will take a raw, messy retail sales dataset and apply data cleaning techniques to make it analysis-ready. The final output should be a cleaned CSV and a report or notebook explaining the steps taken.

📌 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, students should be able to:

✅ Understand the common data quality issues

Missing values

Incorrect formats

Duplicate entries

Inconsistent categories

Wrong data types

✅ Apply cleaning techniques

Detect and handle missing data

Standardize text categories

Convert column data types (e.g., dates, numbers)

Remove or correct duplicates

Fix invalid values

✅ Use tools and libraries

Students can use Python + Pandas, OpenRefine, or Excel/Google Sheets depending on course scope.

🛠 Suggested Tasks

Here’s what students should do (guided checklist):

🧹 1. Load & Inspect the Data

Read the CSV and inspect rows/columns

Print basic summary (shape, dtypes, sample rows)

❓ 2. Identify Issues

Count nulls/missing values

Find inconsistent text categories

Detect weird row entries

🔄 3. Clean the Data

Fill or drop missing values thoughtfully

Standardize inconsistent text labels

Convert date and numeric fields to correct types

Remove duplicates

Correct obvious errors (e.g., negative prices)

📊 4. Save Clean CSV

Save cleaned data as a new CSV file

Compare before/after metrics (null counts, row count, etc.)

🧾 5. Documentation

In a notebook/report, students should include:

What issues were found

What steps were done to fix them

Before & after views

Code + explanation

📌 Optional Advanced Extensions

Give bonus points for:

✨ Handling outliers
✨ Visualizing missing data (heatmaps, etc.)
✨ Creating summary insights from cleaned dataset (e.g., total sales per category)
✨ Using OpenRefine to automate transformations
